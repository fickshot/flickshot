Earlier this week, the Finnish organization **ENCE eSports** announced the return of Aleksi "**allu**" Jalli for a third run under this tag. His last visit was in 2016 after the NiP experiment, remaining 7 months before joining FaZe then OpTic. It is kind of in the same configuration that he returns today to the fold to write a new chapter in his career.

He is indeed at the centre of a project to recreate a Finnish team that could possibly reach the top level, and has already signed a 2-year contract. The Lahden Pelicans Hockey Club is a partner in this project to help ENCE with marketing, sales and event production.

To accompany allu, four local players were chosen by the organization. According to our information, we will find the (very) young hope who played at HAVU, Jere **"sergej"** Salo. The latter has just turned 16, which will facilitate his participation in the various leagues.

Then we simply find one player from each Finnish top team. On the HAVU side, it is Aleksi **"Aleksib"** Virolainen, then there is the iGame player Sami "**xseveN**" Laasanen, and finally Jani **"Aerial"** Jussila who comes from SuperJymy. All of them are close to signing with ENCE.

Some players are still under contract and must therefore be bought back when others will see their contracts ending soon. Once all these details are settled, **ENCE** should therefore look like :
