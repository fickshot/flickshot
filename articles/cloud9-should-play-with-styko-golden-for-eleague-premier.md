A few days ago, we announced some upheavals to come at **mibr** as Tarik “**tarik**” Celik who should join the band in place of Ricardo "**boltz**" Prass, as revealed by [dbltap](https://www.dbltap.com/posts/6112499-sources-tarik-in-talks-to-potentially-join-mibr). The finalization is underway and an official announcement is expected within the week.

We also revealed that Marcelo "**coldzera**" David was thinking about leaving mibr after the next major and was not very happy with his current teammates, including Gabriel "**FalleN**" Toledo and Fernando **"fer"** Alvarenga with whom he is not on the same wavelength in regards to their work ethic.

**Cloud9** is now left with only three players due to the upcoming departure of tarik and Pujan **"FNS"** Mehta being benched. According to our information, Martin "**STYKO**" Styk should continue his stand-in role at least for the next competition, the ELEAGUE Premier 2018 from 21 to 29 July.

He will not be the only stand-in as another benched player is expected to make his appearance under the new black jersey of the cloud formation, Maikil **"Golden"** Selim. The Swede has been on the fnatic bench since the arrival of draken and will therefore have the opportunity to rise to the top very soon. A $1,000,000 competition and some of the best teams in the world, enough to test the two players who have both been recently put aside.

**Cloud9** in ELEAGUE Premier 2018 should look like :
