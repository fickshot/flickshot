Earlier today, we announced to you the arrival of Hovik '**KQLY**' Tovmassian at Vexed to participate in the ESL Championnat National Summer 2017\. Following this announcement, two players of Vexed, Steve '**Jarod**' Cohen and Léonard '**SmyLi**' Michelino, have brought forward a statement announcing their desire to be benched from the active lineup of their team, the two members having not been consulted regarding the arrival of KQLY.

Here is their statement:

Hello to all, We were not informed of this decision that was imposed to us. We were informed of it right before the official announcement. We cannot imagine ourselves working with someone that has harmed, to the extent that he has, the competitive integrity of CS. We therefore disassociate ourselves from this decision that we deem unethical. @vexedjarod and myself have informed @Vexed\_GG that we wish to be benched. 

**Vexed** would now be composed of:

Victor '**Roombang'** Henkinet  
Pierre '**NpK'** Henkinet  
Hovik **'** **KQLY'** Tovmassian _(trial)_  
  
Steve **'** **Jarod'** Cohen _(benched)_  
Léonard **'** **SmyLi'** Michelino _(benched)_
