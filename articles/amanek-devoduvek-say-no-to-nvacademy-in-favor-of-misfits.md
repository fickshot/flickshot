Several weeks ago, David '**devoduvek**' Dobrosavljevic was bought out of Vexed by **EnVyUs** who wanted to reintroduce their lineup by integrating young players. devoduvek was one of them but he was quickly sidelined when Adil '**Scream**' Benrlitom changed his mind and in favor of Alexandre '**xms**' Forté who was not initially supposed to be part of the adventure.

Following devoduvek's departure, Vexed has encountered internal issues and has decided to let go of his partner, François '**AmaNEk**' Delaunay as well as another player who has proved himself at a high level recently, Ali '**hAdji**' Haïnouss. These three were the core of a new project with EnVyUs, as well as in search of two new players in order to integrate a potential Academy lineup.

As we explained it during our podcast (The Freezetime #1) last week, the two last members of this project come from another lower tier team, Tortues Ninja (Ninja Turtles in English). Despite good results, the opportunity to join a reputable organization has interfered with the TN Project which was clearly promising, with good victories in France with online cups, the Epsilan #14 but also in Europe with Assembly Winter 2017\. Lambert '**Lambert**' Prigent and Julien '**PetiSkel**' Marcantoni are thus completing this promising team.

As the announcement of this lineup was beginning to drag out, forcing the three core players to play as a mix under the RANKS tag, most of the details were finally settled and everything was ready for last Saturday April 1st. But a last minute turnaround was not expected. The American organization **Misfits** had contacted the AmaNEk/devoduvek duo to recruit them and complete their lineup.

Under the leadership of Sean '**sgares**' Gares and alongside Shahzeeb '**ShahZaM**' Khan and the young Hunter '**SicK**' Mims, the two players, after careful consideration, will attempt an overseas adventure and reach an eSport and financial milestone with a salary of several thousand euros. While they had initially chosen nV.Academy, it's Misfits that has taken a lead in the negotiations. The nV Academy project is in stand-by for now.

In addition to David '**Xp3**' Garrido, a new batch of French players will thus cross the ocean to take on a great challenge and will settle in California. Misfits will let go of Russel "**Twistzz**" Van Dulken, who is apparently close to joining Team Liquid, as well as Skyler "**Relyks**" Weaver, who is set aside, and also awaits the official arrival of the Brazilian Luis '**peacemaker**' Tadeau as their coach.

**Misfits** will now be represented by : 

Sean "**sgares**" Gares  
Shahzeeb "**ShahZaM**" Khan  
Hunter "**SicK**" Mims  
David "**devoduvek**" Dobrosavljevic  
François "**AmaNEk**" Delaunay

Luis **"peacemaker"** Tadeu _(coach)_
