Flickshot announced it to you a few days ago and it is now official, **EnVyUs** has just announced the arrival of Fabien "**kioShiMa**" Fiey who will replace Alexandre "**xms**" Forté. The EnVyUs saga continues with this time some news regarding **EnVyUs Academy**.  
  
According to our sources, Lambert "**Lambert**" Prigent and his players are on the market. EnVyUs would be open to offers for its team, which is still under contract until next June.  
  
Academy teams can sometimes be used as a way to improve a local scene but also as stepping stones for younger players, as it was the case with Maikil **"Golden"** Selim for fnatic and more recently with Daniel **"mertz"** Mertz with North. However, the academy teams tend to become a source of conflict, as the rules concerning these teams and multi-property become increasingly strict.

Whether in France or even in Europe, EnVyUs Academy is a solid name of the lower tier with a recent victory in the Gfinity Elite Series Season 2 and France ESL Championnat National Winter 2017 and currently has a slot in the Mountain Dew League alongside teams such as Gambit, Virtus Pro, Space Soldiers, Sprout, Flipsid3 or BIG.  
  
In addition, the formation has promising young talents like Ali **"hAdji"** Haïnouss, Audric **"JACKZ"** Jug as well as Valentin "**VKLL**" Bartolomei who could potentially pass a stage one day.  
  
When contacted by FlickShot, EnVyUs did not wish to comment.  
  
However, **EnVyUs Academy** remains:
