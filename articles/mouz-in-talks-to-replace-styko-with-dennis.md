Here we are ! The transfer period is in full swing with announcements and rumors coming from all sides. After North and EnVyUs yesterday, Virtus Pro last week, it's now **mousesports**' turn to be at the heart of change. After a rather good major, the European team is preparing to make a change to move up a level.

According to our information, mouz is currently in advanced talks with GODSENT for the purchase of Swedish pistol master Dennis "**dennis**" Edman. The latter has been benched for a few weeks now after the failure of the project GODSENT created around him. He has been looking for a new challenge ever since and now it seems that the former fnatic player is ready to get back to the international stage, as he had already been in a team with multiple nationalities with Kinguin & G2 Esports.

His arrival would mean sidelining a player and it is the last arrived that would be removed from the formation, Martin "**STYKO**" Styk. The 21-year-old Slovakian showed some great things with HellRaisers before arriving at mousesports last August and even if the results were sufficient with this all-new top-8 major team, it seems that the possibility to add a player with dennis' talent and experience is fatal to him. It would not be a first for dennis, the Swede having already played with mousesports instead of oskar last December during a LOOT Bet qualifier.

Flickshot reached out to RFRSH for a comment and they confirmed that there "_are in ongoing discussions with multiple parties_".

If the negotiations go well, **mousesports** should look like:
