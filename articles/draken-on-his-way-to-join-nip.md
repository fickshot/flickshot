Now a legendary team since their incredible start on CS:GO with 87 maps consecutively won on LAN, **Ninjas in Pyjamas** are without a doubt part of the game's history. Whether it be on the first version in the early beginnings of CS, the second version in 1.6 and their successors, a decade after the first adventure, on CS:GO.

Except this status of the #1 team from the start of Global Offensive no longer accompanies the teammates of Christopher '**GeT\_RiGhT**' Alesund, who since their final at the IEM Katowice 2015, only seem to periodically win competitions. Three good titles in 2016 that come after no big title in 2015 and in parallel a good number of losses far from the top 3\. Worse even, their fall at the Major is clear, top 3/4 at Cluj in 2015, top 5/8 in Columbus 2016, top 9/12 at Cologne 2016, the loss of the Legend title and finally a failure to qualify for the ELEAGUE 2017 Major, a bit of a descent into the depths.

The causes of this plunge are many but NiP is not very fond of changes. Indeed, since the departure of Robin '**Fifflaren**' Johansson, the fifth seat at NiP changes regularly. Mikail '**Maikelele**' Bill, Aleksi '**allu**' Jalli and Jacob '**pyth**' Mourujärvi having one by one occupied the position. With the arrival of pyth, the Ninjas found themselves without an AWPer and it is thus the legend Patrik 'f0rest' Lindberg that uses the green rifle the most. The core of the four players is thus always the same.

This choice of not changing their core has prevented the recruitment of some of the best Swedish players such as Olof '**olofmeister**' Kajbjer, Dennis '**dennis**' Edman, Jesper '**JW**' Wecksell and others at moment where they could have benefited of their strong position to bring in the best elements in the country. This unwillingness to take a decision and the loyalty of this core of players has allowed fnatic to surpass them with time and it seems today unlikely that players of this level will join NiP at any point in time.

This is why Ninjas in Pyjamas are preparing to welcome a new player: the young AWPer William '**draken**' Sundin. According to our sources, the Epsilon player has left his former teammates yesterday and is on his way to NiP. Moreover, Draken's time in Epsilon does not seem to have ended in the best of terms. From NiP's side of things, it is without any surprises that Jacob '**pyth**' Morujärvi will be leaving the lineup.

An interesting choice from the perspective of the future and of strategy as NiP will recruit a young talent that they will be able to form, which they have not been able to do with Maikelele for example, and more specifically they welcoming an AWPer that will be able to give f0rest more freedom as to his playstyle and weapon choice.

This is how **Ninjas in Pyjamas** should look like soon :

Richard "**Xizt**" Landström  
Patrik "**f0rest**" Lindberg  
Christopher "**GeT\_RiGhT**" Alesund  
Adam "**friberg**" Friberg  
William **"draken"** Sundin
