Back in February, **EnVyUs** made changes to their roster by replacing two players, after their failure at the ELEAGUE Major Boston. Alexandre "**xms**" Forté and Christophe **"SIXER"** Xia were thus put aside, while Fabien "**kioShiMa**" Fiey and Ali **"hAdji"** Haïnouss were recruited. xms and SIXER are still on the bench of the American organization as of today.

With this new project, EnVyUs were looking to bounce back after a complicated 2017\. New players, new mentality, new positions, new ambitions, everything seemed logical and credible in how they approached this new adventure. Unfortunately, troublesome beginnings have greatly delayed the preparation and cancelled the "honeymoon" effect that can propel a team that changes one or more players.

During their two offline events, EnVyUs didn't really shine, first with a failure at WESG, where they finished 3rd in the second group phase behind the Russian mix and the Koreans from MVP, while they had to settle for a draw against the Indonesians of Recca. Then, at DreamHack Masters Marseille, Happy's men ended up 3rd in their group behind FaZe but ahead of G2\. A "logical" result in the end. In the ESL Pro League, they finished 12th out of 14.

According to our information, EnVyUs will part ways with their coach Damien **"maLeK"** Marcel who arrived in February 2017\. As the French scene moves towards a 4th shuffle, the objective for nV will be to get a shot in the arm of a formation that will play the relegation tournament of the ESL Pro League and the next DreamHack Tours, two tournaments that will certainly be decisive for their future, as a team but also with their organization.

**EnVyUs** would therefore currently be:
