A few days ago, **Imperial** announced the exclusion of their star player Rokas "**EspiranTo**" Milasauskas. The reason was related to the disagreement of the latter with the latest player to come into the team, in-game leader Kevin **"** **kRYSTAL** **"** Amend, who replaced Asger "AcilioN" Larsen⁠. EspiranTo said that he does not want to play under the lead of the German player and that his lead would have an impact on his level.

According to our information, the situation would have evolved in favor of the Lithuanian player and he would be on his way back to the team. EspiranTo's return means that kRYSTAL would be kicked, a month and a half after his arrival.

The former Sprout player would be replaced by the young Slovak hope who played for eXtatus, David **"frozen"** Čerňanský, who turned 16 last month and can now play most competitions without any problems. This is not the only change that would impact the team. 

Indeed, Jesper "**TENZKI**" Plougmann would also be excluded from the team and Nikola "**Lobanjica**" Mijomanović would replace him and take the lead of the squad. The latter is mainly known for his good results in FPL but does not really have any team experience at 28\. Both Frozen and Lobanjica are on trial for now. Their first official match is expected to be Friday versus Epsilon in Starladder.  
  
**Imperial** should therefore look like :
