A year ago, **fnatic** and **GODSENT** started one of the most unexpected shuffle by mixing their players. Surprisingly, **GODSENT** signed the multiple major winners Jesper "**JW**" Wecksell, Robin "**flusha**" RÃ¶nnquist and Freddy "**KRiMZ**" Johansson to join previous fnatic players, reassembling 80% of the formation that won the first major with Andreas "**znajder**" Lindberg and a special in-game leader named Markus "**pronax**" Wallsten.

On the other side, Olof "**olofmeister**" Kajbjer and Dennis "**dennis**" Edmann started over with two players from the **GODSENT** side, Jonas "**Lekr0**" Olofsson and Simon "**twist**" Eliasson not forgetting their stand-in at the time, John "**wenton**" Eriksson. Even if lekr0 and KRiMZ were quickly switched and wenton was replaced by Joakim "**disco doplan**" Gidetun, the two formations did not really do well and stayed in the soft underbelly of the World's Top teams. fnatic still managed to reach the semi-finals of the ELEAGUE major.

Following this major, complete rewind, JW and flusha went back to fnatic replacing twist and disco doplan which are going to GODSENT, a new trade that recreated the old fnatic, giving themselves a new hope to get back to the top level they had reached when they started together. Unfortunately, the issues that forced them to split at the time did not disappear and even after a good top 5/8 at Krakow's major, the team is once again on the edge of the abyss.

According to our information, the composition has separated again into two disctinct groups with on one side the trio JW/KRiMZ/flusha and the duo dennis/olofmeister on the other. The difference is that this time, fnatic will stay with it's trio and not with dennis and olof who are thought to leave the formation or sit on the bench awaiting a possible departure. The issues are apparently "general", mostly about tactics and players's goodwill.  
Still according to our information, the favorite to take a spot in the team is the young in-game leader from fnatic Academy, Maikil "**Golden**" Selim. He could be very close to step up and his arrival would be very easy to deal with since he is already a member of the fnatic organisation.

The last spot is still open but according to our sources, dennis has been offered to GODSENT in exchange for Jonas "**Lekr0**" Olofsson who could fill the last spot and return to fnatic, one year after his very short adventure. On his side, dennis could be joining GODSENT while olofmeister is thinking about his future, the rumors announce him to FaZe but we cannot confirm that information right now.
