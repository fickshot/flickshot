A few days ago, we learned of the departures of Jacob **"** **pyth** **"**Mourujärvi and Mattias "**bENNY**" Rosback from the **Chaos** formation, a few weeks after Aleksandr "**jayzaR**" Zarkovic had been sidelined. Markus "**pronax**" Wallsten and Mikail "**Maikelele**" Bill thus found themselves with three vacant spots in the formation.

According to our information, the triple major winner and DH Winter 2014 finalist have found the three players to complete their team. It would be three former Japaleno who have just separated after the failure in the Minor qualifier. They are the twins Joakim **"Relaxa"** Gustafsson and Fredrik **"FREDDyFROG"** Gustafsson as well as the ex-fnatic and fnatic Academy player, Niclas **"PlesseN"** Plessen.

Another former fnatic player is joining them with Jonatan **"Devilwalk"** Lundberg who is taking over a coaching role after trying a comeback as a player. As a reminder, the latter won a major as a player then another as a coach, with fnatic both times.

With this recruitment, Chaos offer itself great firepower, the Gustafsson twins having shown beautiful things in game as well as excellent statistics. Is this finally a return to a better level for the two former Swedish stars?

**Chaos** should look like:
