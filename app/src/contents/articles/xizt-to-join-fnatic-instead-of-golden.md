Last summer, flickshot informed you that a new upheaval was announced in **fnatic**, after the double shuffle that had taken place with GODSENT the year before. This change saw the departure of Olof "**olofmeister**" Kajbjer and Dennis "**dennis**" Edman and the arrival of Jonas "**Lekr0**" Olofsson and the young in-game leader of the Academy team, Maikil **"Golden"** Selim.

This new composition has since regained a pretty good level, achieving some good results like two 3/4 tops in the EPL S6 and ECS S4 finals, a Legend status at the major and very recently an epic top 1 in IEM Katowice.

In spite of this recent result, it seems that not everything was perfect within the team. Therefore, according to our information, a change is planned in the Swedish team. Maikil **"Golden"** Selim, the least experienced player and leader at the top level, is the one who should be out of the starting line-up despite having demonstrated a good individual level. The problem would seem to concern an aspect outside the game.

His replacement would be none other than Richard "**Xizt**" Landström who was put on the bench a few weeks ago, after [NiP replaced him](https://nip.gl/images/articles/announcement-roster-change-ninjas-in-pyjamas/) by Dennis "**dennis**" Edman. This move would be a return to fnatic for Xizt, a jersey he wore for almost two years at the end of 1.6\. It is logical that he will take the lead of the formation.  
  
**Fnatic** should look like:
