A few days ago, we announced that there were ongoing negotiations between the **SK Gaming** trio and **Natus Vincere** about the transfer of Oleksandr "**s1mple**" Kostyliev and Egor **"flamie"** Vasilyev to play with the Brazilians instead of Epitácio **"TACO"** de Melo and Ricardo **"boltz"** Prass. Since then, things have changed and according to our information, it was s1mple who decided not to join the South American team, thus cancelling the transfer right before the deal was finalized.

Meanwhile, TACO left the ship and SK was looking for a player to replace him. Also according to our information, the Brazilians have thoroughly considered many players from the international scene and seem determined to open up to communications in English and to add players to their core composed of Gabriel "**FalleN**" Toledo, Fernando **"fer"** Alvarenga and Marcelo "**coldzera**" David.

It seems that they have found the right player, who won't have any problem with regards to moving to the United States since he is American. According to [DBLTAP](http://www.dbltap.com/posts/6014121-sources-sk-gaming-roster-in-talks-about-potentially-adding-stewie2k/partners/40714), and confirmed by our sources, Jack "**Stewie2K**" Yip is the player that the Brazilians have singled out, and negotiations are taking place right now. Ricardo **"boltz"** Prass would therefore save his place in the team and he knows that he will have to improve in the coming months.

As always, if negotiations go well, **SK Gaming** would look like this for a few more months:
