It was more than a month ago now that we had announced the formation of a Dream Team for some, or a Super Team for others, led by Richard '**shox'** Papillon and Nathan '**NBK**' Schmitt as well as players having performed at the top tier for years, with Kenny 'kennyS' Schrub and Dan '**apEX**' Madesclaire. The final addition is none else than the young prodigy Alexandre '**bodyy**' Pianaro who has known a mad 2016 year, going from the lower tier to the international top tier with a certain ease. They will be managed by Jérome '**NiaK**' Sudries and with the great novelty of Édouard '**SmithZz**' Dubourdeaux as their coach but also Niclas "**enkay J**" Krumhorn as analyst.

As this lineup should soon be joining G2 Esports, another french team sees the light of day! Although Kévin '**Ex6TenZ**' Droolans was initially thought to be recruiting the players left out of this "_french shuffle_", it appears today that it is Vincent '**Happy**' Cervoni that has had a grip on the creation of a second team.

Even though **ScreaM** was initially involved in the project, an offer from FaZe switched the cards. Philip '**aizy**' Aistrup is currently in talks with North to replace Ruben '**RUBINO**' Villarroel who would eventually join Joakim '**jkaem**' Myrbostad's project. Even though he has received several offers from Europe and the United States, the Belgian player prefers to remain in Europe and awaits a concrete opportunity from FaZe. In case, this does not happen, a return to France could still be possible.

The first member on the lineup, alongside Happy is G2's Cédric '**RpK**' Guipouy who comes out of a very high performance at the major in a more aggressive role that will remain his within this lineup. The veteran that had stopped playing for 2 years in 2013 and 2014 has finally recovered a very good level after challenging beginnings with Titan. He, also, has played with Happy in Source, but under Epsilon alongside Ex6TenZ in particular, in 2008.

It is then Team-LDLC's player, Alexandre '**xms**' Forté that joins the team after proving himself with his former organization this season. He is thus given a great opportunity to reach the next level, become a great player and to prove that all the hopes placed upon him have not been in vain.

In order to complete the team, we find Christophe '**SIXER**' Xia that joined EnvyUs when replacing DEVIL in October and has had a very complicated major but in obviously special circumstances. He has however shown some interesting elements since his arrival to nV and will finally have the opportunity to retrieve the green rifle that brought him fame in 1.6\. As a reminder to this, kennyS stated to us in the Flickshow #2 that he was, at moments, impressed by SIXER's AWP.

The last player is very young within the french scene and remains on good performances with Vexed and Platinium, David '**devoduvek**' Dobrosavljevic. Beyond his unpronounceable name, he possesses an interesting profile that has attracted the attention of the other members of the team, he will indeed play as the entryfragger and will be closely watched during his first matches with a high level lineup that he has not experienced before. If you do not know him well, you can read his interview that we have conducted two months ago.

Finally, this lineup will be coached by an old CS:S player that has made a recent comeback with Owly-Six as a player, then as a coach. It is Damien '**maLeK**' Marcel. For the youngsters within you, maLeK was part of the top tier in CS:S between 2006 and 2008 before coming back in 2011 and 2012 with Tt.Dragons, already alongside ScreaM and other players such as shox, SmithZz and Uzzziii. Although the organization housing this team is not known, EnVyUs take an interest as well as other organizations that have shown it.

This second french lineup resulting from the French Shuffle will be composed of:

Vincent '**Happy'** Cervoni  
Cédric '**RpK'** Guipouy  
Christophe '**SIXER'** Xia  
Alexandre '**xms'** Forté  
David '**devoduvek'** Dobrosavljevic  
  
Damien "**maLeK**" Marcel _(coach)_
