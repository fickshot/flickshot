Almost three months ago, **OpTic Gaming** released its European players and turned to a brand new Danish-American team with former OpTic player Peter **"stanislaw"** Jarguz and Misfits sniper Shahzeeb **"ShahZaM"** Khan. 

The Green Wall also paid to buy star players like René "**cajunb**" Borg and Kristian **"k0nfig"** Wienecke while trusting the young Nicklas **"gade"** Gade.

Today, according to our information, OpTic has decided to turn to a 100% Danish team without having competed in any offline competition with their current lineup. In order to replace stanislaw in the lead and ShahZaM in the sniper, two players from the Heroic team were chosen. 

Marco **"Snappi"** Pfeiffer and Jakob **"JUGi"** Hansen would be in advanced contact with the American organization to form a team that seems very attractive on paper. The coach Chet **"ImAPet"** Singh should on his side be released and replaced by Casper "**ruggah**" Due.

**OpTic Gaming** should therefore consist of:
