Back in January, Flickshot reported that the Swedish organization **GODSENT** had been put up for sale, partly because of the WESA rules which prohibit the ownership of multiple sports organization in tournaments, but also because Valve took a harder line on the topic. Moreover, the founder of the organization, Markus **"pronax"** Wallsten, was on his way out sooner or later after being benched.

A few days ago, Red Reserve announced that they had recruited the Swedish players from GODSENT. Thus, the classiest brand of the scene could start looking for a new roster to represent this sympathetic tag. But it turns out **that GODSENT will actually cease to operate.**

Indeed, we now know that the sale of the team has ended the project that pronax launched in 2016\. With the withdrawal of RFRSH which managed the operation of the team, Tomas Oropesa Martin, the investor who co-founded the organization with the once legendary leader of fnatic, has no intention to relaunch the structure, which closes its doors as a result.

In its two years of existence, GODSENT has been home to great players, such as Robin **"flusha"** Rönnquist, Jesper "**JW**" Wecksell, Freddy "**KRIMZ**" Johansson or Jonas **"Lekr0"** Olofsson and Simon **"twist"** Eliasson. In other words, some of the best players of the country and even of CS:GO. During this time, GODSENT managed to qualify for a major and was just a few overtime rounds away from a legendary status. We can also note their thundering debut at DreamHack Masters Malmö 2016, where they reached the semi-finals to everyone's surprise.
