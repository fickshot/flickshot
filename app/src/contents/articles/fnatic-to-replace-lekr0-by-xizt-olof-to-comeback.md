More than two months ago, **fnatic** was on the verge of replacing its leader Maikil **"Golden"** Selim despite some good performances. The player chosen to replace him was NiP player Richard "**Xizt**" Landström, who was then on the bench. However, the bad community response as well as the team's victory at WESG cancelled the move.  
  
FaZe Clan eventually picked up the Swedish rifler to replace Olof "**olofmeister**" Kajbjer, while he was out of the team for personal problems. It now appears that the latter is ready to make his return, which pushes Xizt to the bench.

According to our information in collaboration with RushBPodcast, the former Ninjas In Pyjamas player will finally join the team he was destined to join: **fnatic**. This transfer will take place; but he will not replace Golden as decided the first time. He will actually take the spot of Jonas "**Lekr0**" Olofsson.  
  
**Fnatic** should therefore look like :

![Sweden](/images/countries/se.svg)⁠ Jesper "**JW**" Wecksell  
![Sweden](/images/countries/se.svg)⁠ Robin "**flusha**" Rönnquist  
![Sweden](/images/countries/se.svg)⁠ Freddy "**KRiMZ**" Johansson  
![Sweden](/images/countries/se.svg)⁠ Maikil **"Golden"** Selim  
![Sweden](/images/countries/se.svg)⁠ Richard "**Xizt**" Landström

And **FaZe** will once again be:

![Denmark](/images/countries/dk.svg)⁠ ⁠⁠Finn "**karrigan**" Andersen  
![Norway](/images/countries/no.svg)⁠ ⁠Håvard "**rain**" Nygaard  
![Slovakia](/images/countries/sk.svg)⁠ ⁠Ladislav **"GuardiaN"** Kovács  
![Bosnia and Herzegovina](/images/countries/ba.svg)⁠ ⁠Nikola **"NiKo"** Kovač  
![Sweden](/images/countries/se.svg)⁠ Olof "**olofmeister**" Kajbjer
