Early February, **LDLC** took the scene by surprise when they dismissed in-game leader and captain Kevin "**Ex6TenZ**" Droolans after a disappointing performance at Assembly Winter 2018\. The atmosphere within the team was not ideal anymore, and the Belgian was sidelined. To replace him, the young Logan "**logaN**" Corti from Team ARES was brought in, and has put up promising performances since then.

Unfortunately, the team failed to meet with success, such as at Copenhagen Games 2018 where they were kicked out of the BYOC tournament by an unknown team, but also in the various online qualifiers they undertook, and finally as they ended dead last in the regular season of the ESL Pro League S7\. Just as the French scene is on the brink of its fourth shuffle, LDLC may already have its plans for the future.

First of all, the organization would part ways with two players. Timothée "DEVIL" Demolon⁠—who took over as in-game leader after Ex6TenZ—would be excluded from the formation, and Mathieu "Maniac" Quiquerez⁠ might have expressed his will to stop the adventure.

The "Americans" of the French scene David "**devoduvek**" Dobrosavljevic and François "**AmaNEk**" Delaunay would replace them, finally bouncing back after the end of the Misfits adventure a few months ago. Both actually played with ALEX and logaN during the recent DreamHack Open Valencia Qualifier.

**Team LDLC** would thus look like this:
