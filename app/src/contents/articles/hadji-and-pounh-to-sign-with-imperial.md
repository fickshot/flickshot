After Kevin **"** **kRYSTAL** **"** Amend and Jesper "**TENZKI**" Plougmann were put aside, the **Imperial** formation took Nikola "**Lobanjica**" Mijomanović and Eimantas "**pounh**" Lazickas as trials. If the first was quickly dismissed, the second seems very well integrated and shows a very satisfying level.

The Lobanjica trial was stopped after just a few days, despite good results. The reason being that the Montenegrin would have a negative impact on the organization's image, who took this decision in order to "_protect the organization and the sponsors_". So it appears that it's not a player's choice.

The Lithuanian team has found a replacement with former EnVyUs player Ali **"hAdji"** Haïnouss who previously only acted as a stand-in. According to our sources, it seems that the Frenchman's influence on the team is very positive and that he should finally join the team.

He would sign a contract with Imperial, just like Eimantas "**pounh**" Lazickas who convinced his compatriots to have him signed as well.

**The Imperial** should therefore look like :
