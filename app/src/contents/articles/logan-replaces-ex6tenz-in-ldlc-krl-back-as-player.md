Flickshot announced it to you yesterday in exclusive, a big change was happening in **Team LDLC** with the exclusion of the legendary leader Kevin "**Ex6TenZ**" Droolans. The latter then confirmed that the information was true and that he was benched. Timothée "**DEVIL**" Demolon will thus logically lead the team.

We also talked about negotiations with EnVyUs for Alexandre "**xms**" Forté but in the end, it was another player who was chosen to represent the fox. He arrives straight from Team ARES, it's the young Logan "**logaN**" Corti. After testing his skills with beGenius in late 2016, the player exploded with MaxiSaucisse and then ARES when he replaced DEVIL last July.

It took him 14 months to switch from being an unknown player to the player who will replace Ex6TenZ in LDLC. It's been a hell of a journey, and it has only just begun. 

For its part, ARES sees Sébastien "**KRL**" Pérez's coming back as a player, at least for the coming month, while the players wait for the end of their contracts with ARES and a possible new venture. 

**Team LDLC** is now :
