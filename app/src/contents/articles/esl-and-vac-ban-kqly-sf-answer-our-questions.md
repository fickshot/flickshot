Whereas the Electronic Sports League has just clarified its ruling concerning VAC Bans, thus allowing all players having been banned by VAC or by their own Anti-Cheat for at least two years to participate in its competitions once again, we met with two players banned by VAC about two years and a half ago, Hovik '**KQLY**' Tovmassian and Gordon '**Sf**' Giry. Consequently, they react to this news, talk about what's next for them and of these two years in purgatory.

**Hey KQLY, you've heard the news, what's are your first thoughts? Logical decision in your opinion?**

Hey neL, well it makes me glad to read this kind of news but I don't really know what to think of it. It's pretty cool of them to take a step forward and to give us a second chance, it shows that they are human and that they think of us a little bit :D After all, errare humanum est, right?

**You can therefore officially compete again - Do you have the ambition to get back into the french Top/Lower tier or have you moved on?**

It's a very difficult question in the sense that when it comes to the Top tier... you can pretty much forget it since the top teams obviously aim for other tournaments such as the Major or the Minor or the Dreamhacks (I think DH follows Valve's ruling). So it's a bit complicated to return to the top. As for the lower tier, since my ban you can imagine that pretty much 99% of the players hate me... if I was given a chance, I would obviously not decline it but we don't live in Cloud Cuckoo Land :(

**Two years and a half have passed since the infamous event, what does your life look like today? Does this news change anything?**

Since my ban, I have continued to play, whether it be on stream or out, when you love the game you can't stop overnight. Of course, I've made mistakes that I regret but that doesn't mean that I should be forbidden from enjoying myself in a game that I love. So I've continued to play and to stream since my ban and I've been lucky that my stream has been doing well. That has allowed me to pay the bills and for that I'd like to thank every single one of you that has continued to to support me during my streams. THANK YOU! And I don't think that, at the moment, this news changes anything for me :P

**Hey Sf, you've heard the news, what's are your first thoughts? Logical decision in your opinion?**

Hey, it's been a while! Well first of all, it's cool but nothing else, in the sense that things are getting better when it comes to the "clarification" of punishments. They aren't the first ones to enforce this rule (ESWC for example) regarding players banned for cheating. Logical decision, yes and no. I think that there's another priority than us (less than ten people affected) to deal with. The players banned for match-fixing should have a more forgiving punishment, and especially when you compare the different individual cases (age, winnings...). They should have a more suitable sanction. When it comes to cheating, it's the same thing, it should be case by case : where? when? how many times? They are very much aware of all this. However it would imply that Valve should change their policy, that they finally communicate and not only to deliver bans/sanctions.

**You can therefore officially compete again - Do you have the ambition to get back into the french Top/Lower tier or have you moved on?**

I've been able to play a few LANs with mixes during the last two years. But indeed, competing (with a team) or even just the environment and the vibes that you get from it, I miss it all terribly. Even if I never counted on getting unbanned, as that seemed unlikely. But it wouldn't sadden me to return to the scene. If one day I was given the opportunity, it would be to show you that I did not get where I was by cheating and I never needed it to show an acceptable level of play.

**Two years and a half have passed since the infamous event, what does your life look like today? Does this news change anything?**

My life hasn't really changed since then, I had always worked 3/4 of the time when I was playing. I took the opportunity to find another perspective in my line of work and to set up my own business. Now, at the current time, I'm retraining. Maybe it will open more doors for us and therefore more offers or possibilities from organizations and players. We'll see what happens next, the opportunity to come back is a possibility just like the opposite.
