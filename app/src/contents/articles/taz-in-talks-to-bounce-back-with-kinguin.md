A month ago, **[Virtus.pro](https://Virtus.pro)** had benched its captain and one of its historical players, Wiktor "**TaZ**" Wojtas after months and more generally a complicated 2017\. While at times they managed to pull out big wins over the years, periods of doubt where bad results followed one another became more and more frequent until the team became close to a permanent failure.

Wheras the Poles have given a chance to Michał "**MICHU**" Müller, nothing seems to be done so far, [as revealed to us](https://flickshot.fr/en/kuben-nous-avons-deja-oublie-comment-gagner-les-grands-matchs/&5a9acaf5392cb) by Jakub "**kuben**" Gurczyński at the IEM Katowice where he explained that VP was going to "_consider a buyout or test another player_". His arrival has not changed anything in the results so far, as we've seen at IEM and StarSeries.

According to our information, TaZ is already on the verge of bouncing back with a new project. Indeed, he is in talks with **Kinguin** to revive the lineup which has lost its place as second team of the country for some time now, seeing AGO and even Pride outpace them. After having recruited the Portuguese duo Ricardo "**fox**" Pacheco and Christopher "**MUTiRiS**" Fernandes, Kinguin did nothing but complicate the situation and MICHU's departure (on loan for the moment) did not help.

That's why the two Portuguese would be dismissed and two players from the Pride squad are expected to join the penguin composition. A return to a 100% Polish project with Jacek **"MINISE"** Jeziak and Paweł **"reatz"** Jańczak, the two members who would complete the Kinguin team.

If the negotiations go well, **Kinguin** should look like:
